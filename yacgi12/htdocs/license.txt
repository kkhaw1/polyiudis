YACGI Nonexclusive Commercial License

The licensee named below is granted the right to utilize YACGI, 
major version 1, any minor version thereof, in CGI applications
without the need for a credit notice of any kind. 

CGI applications developed by the holder of this license may be
distributed freely in source code or binary form without 
additional fees or royalties. 

This license does not grant the right to use YACGI to create a 
development tool which passes on substantially all of the 
capabilities of the YACGI library to the user of the tool, unless 
that tool is to be used internally by the license holder only in
order to develop CGI applications. 

This license may not be resold, but applications developed in 
accordance with the terms of the license may be distributed
freely subject to the limitations described above.

Future minor (1.x) versions of YACGI will be covered by this
license free of charge. If significant defects of workmanship
are discovered in version 1.x, minor releases to correct them
will be made available before or at the same time that 
those defects are addressed in any future major version. 

Future "major" (2.x) versions will be available to licensees at
an upgrade price of $15.

If, for any reason, any portion of this license is found to be 
invalid, that portion of the license only is invalidated and the
remainder of the agreement remains in effect.

If this license has not been signed by Andrew Girow (Andriy Zhyrov). 
it is invalid.
